Corine Land Cover - European seamless raster files (Version 2020_20u1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the Corine Land Cover European seamless raster files derived from the Corine Land Cover European seamless vector database. 
Version 2020 20u1 (dated 02/2020) in GeoTiff format. 

Original vector databases were provided by National Teams within CLC1990, IMAGE&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006, Copernicus CLC2012 update and Copernicus CLC2018 update projects. 
All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images 
with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU 
for change layer) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). 
Harmonization on country border done only for CLC2000 and CHA9000 layers (2km strip). For other layers only small sliver polygons 
along borders (0,1ha) has been dissolved.
All seamless vector layers were rasterized to the 100m resolution grid. CELL_CENTER method was used for the rasterizing.  
European Corine Land Cover seamless raster files represent the final raster product of European data integration. 

All data files are accompanied with standard ISO XML metadata (see supporting files/XML_metadata).

Raster version 2020 20u1 database delivery (in 100m resolution) contains:

File naming conventions: 

Filename is composed of combination of information about update campaign, data theme and reference year and version specification (including release year and release number) 
UPDATE CAMPAIGN | THEME | REFERENCE YEAR | RELEASE YEAR | RELEASE NUMBER 

UPDATE CAMPAIGN:
•	update campaign refers to the year of the CLC campaign, when the file content was last modified or updated 
THEME:
•	theme refers to specific CLC layer type: clc - refers to status layer, cha - refers to change layer
REFERENCE YEAR: 
•	reference year refers to the year for which CLC information included in the file were mapped
RELEASE YEAR:
•	release year refers to the year of CLC data release 
RELEASE NUMBER:
•	release number refers to a sequential numbering of CLC data releases. Initially it is named as a beta version (e.g. 20b2) until the new complete final version is ready covering the full territory (e.g. 20). Any subsequent minor update is recorded as incremental number in suffix (e.g. 20u1)


Examples:
U<update campaign>_<theme><reference year>_V<release year>_<release number>

status file name: U2006_CLC2000_V2020_20b2' means
U2006 - last modification / update of the file is from the 2006 mapping campaign 
CLC2000 - file contains CLC status data for reference year 2000
V2020_20b2 - file was released in 2020 as second beta version (incomplete) of version 20


change file name: file name 'U2018_CHA1218_V2020_20u1' means
U2018 - last modification / update of the file is from the 2018 mapping campaign 
CHA1218 - file contains CLC change data between reference years 2012 and 2018 
V2020_20u1 - file was released in 2020 as a first update of final version 20

Change layers in raster
----------------------
In order to keep 8bit resolution for raster version, change layers are divided into two files. 

Vector file name:  
U2018_CHA1218_V2020_20u1

Raster files name: 
U2018_CHA1218_12_V2020_20u1 - file contains consumption part of change (‘from’ code)
U2018_CHA1218_18_V2020_20u1 - file contains formation part of change (‘to’ code)

Overseas countries and territories - Overseas departments (DOMs)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Overseas countries and territories are delivered as separate package to keep consistency between vector and raster delivery. Structure of the delivery and file naming conventions are the same except DOM specification (country code and DOM code) suffix.
UPDATE CAMPAIGN | THEME | REFERENCE YEAR | RELEASE YEAR | RELEASE NUMBER | COUNTRY CODE | DOM CODE

Example:
U<update campaign>_<theme><reference year>_V<release year>_<release number>_<country code>_<DOM code>

file name: U2006_CLC2000_V2018_20b2_FR_GLP' means
U2006 - last modification / update of the file is from the 2006 mapping campaign 
CLC2000 - file contains CLC status data for reference year 2000
V2018_20b2 - file was released in 2018 as second beta version (incomplete) of version 20
FR - file is for French territory 
GLP – DOM name is Guadeloupe
 

In order to keep 8bit resolution for change layers, they are divided into two files. 
U2018_CHA1218_12_V2020_20u1 - file contains consumption part of change (‘from’ code)
U2018_CHA1218_18_V2020_20u1 - file contains formation part of change (‘to’ code)

Changes from previous release - change log:

Version 20
----------
Release date: 24-02-2020 (see V20u1)
Main purpose of the release: Publication of the final, corrected CLC2018 data.
The 5th CLC inventory for the reference year of 2018 was produced under the Copernicus programme. It has the shortest production time in history of CLC updates (< 1 year). Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 satellite provided information for CLC2018 database creation. In majority of countries a visual photointerpretation (CAPI) following uniform methodology (CLC2018 Technical Guidelines) was applied. In several countries (FI, IE, IS, NL, NO, PT, SE) a “semi-automated” methodology (country specific due to availability of national data) was utilized combining image processing, in-situ data integration and cartographic generalisation. Full bottom-up solution based on generalisation of high-resolution national land monitoring data was practised in DE and ES. Most of the QC was conducted in remote verifications. IT and ES were verified by regions. In producing the European products, a simplified border matching was applied (see Version 15).  
Changes from previous main release (Version 18): 
•	Inclusion of clc2018 layers for all the EEA39 countries.
•	Production of clc2018 for Faroe Islands.
•	Revised clc2012 layers were made available for 38 countries (only original clc2012 layer included for FI). clc2012 layers have been replaced by revised clc2012 on land.copernicus.eu portal.
•	Change in rasterization algorithm (using again CELL CENTRE method starting from V20b1)
•	Change in naming convention - https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-file-naming-conventions-guide-v20u1
Known problems: 
•	Some redundant lines between neighbouring polygons with the same code are still present, but only as result of persisting ‘adaptive tilling’ procedure (limitation of ESRI ArcGIS technology for large datasets).
•	Polygons <25 ha can be present along national borders and along 'adaptive tilling' tiles boundaries.

Lineage of V20 sub-releases:
Version 20u1
------------ 
Release date: 24-02-2020
Main purpose of the release: Maintenance / Correction of final CLC2018 data.
Changes from previous release (20): 
•	File naming conventions simplified and better described. New file naming convention has been introduced based on user feedback on version 20. Filename is composed of combination of information about update campaign, data theme and reference year and version specification (including release year and release number). See https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-file-naming-conventions-guide-v20u1 
•	The French DOMs are provided in separate databases (files both for vector and raster version of data).
•	All raster layers are back in 8 bit GeoTIFF. Modification is introduced based on the user feedback on version 20. In order to keep 8 bit resolution for raster change layers, they are divided into two files - representing consumption (from) and formation (to) part of change.
See https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-country-coverage-1990-2018-v20u1 for full information about the coverage of this version.

Version 20
----------
Release date:1-05-2019
Main purpose of the release: Publication of the final, corrected CLC2018 data.
Changes from previous sub-release (20b2):
•	clc2012, clc2018, cha1218  data for Turkey added
•	clc2018 data for Faroe Islands (DK) added
•	some mistakes and misinterpretation in database reported by users and NTs were repaired (FR and BE)
See https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-country-coverage-v20/view for full information about this version coverage

Version 20b2
------------
Release date: 19-12-2018
Main purpose of the release: Publication of the pre-final CLC2018 data.
Changes from previous sub-release (20b1):
•	Complete vector/raster time series (clc1990, clc2000, clc2006, clc2012, clc20108, cha9000, cha0006, cha0612, cha1218)
•	clc2012, clc2018, cha1218 data for Italy added
•	Coding for rasters changed - rasters contains directly CLC codes/changes values. So status rasters produced as 16-bit depth, change rasters produced as 32-bit depth 
See https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-country-coverage-v20b2/view for full for full information about this version coverage

Version 20b1 
------------
Release date 16-11-2018
Main purpose of the release: First partial CLC2018 update data, new accounting layers preparation to support SOER2020
Only raster files (the same cha9000, cha0006, cha0612 files as V18_5_1 re-rasterized by CELL CENTRE method) and new CLC2012 and CLC2018 raster files were delivered.
Data for Italy and Turkey still missing


Version 18
----------
Release date: 19-09-2016 (see V18_5_1)
Main purpose of the release: Publication of the final, corrected CLC2012 data.
The 4th CLC inventory for the reference year of 2012 was produced under the Copernicus Initial Operations (GIO). Two high-resolution satellite image coverages (IRS Resourcesat-1/2, SPOT-4/5, RapidEye constellation) taken in 2011-2012 provided multi-temporal information to support the update. Computer Assisted Photointerpretation (CAPI) was the prevailing methodology applied in interpreting of satellite images. FI, DE, IS, IE, NO, ES and SE applied a semi-automatic methodology. UK has turned from semiautomatic processing to CAPI because no national hi-res dataset was available for 2012. Most of the QC was conducted in remote verifications. IT and ES were verified by regions. In producing the European products, a simplified border matching was applied (see Version 15). Validation: 
Changes from previous main release (Version 17): 
•	Inclusion of CLC2012 layers for all the EEA39 countries.
•	Production of CLC2006 for Greece (in V18_3) and all CLCs for Channel Islands (V18_1).
•	Revised CLC2000 and CLC2006 layers were made available (V18_5).
•	Change in rasterization algorithm (V18_2).
Known problems: 
•	Some redundant lines between neighbouring polygons with the same code are still present, but only as result of persisting ‘adaptive tilling’ procedure (limitation of ESRI ArcGIS technology for large datasets).
•	Polygons <25 ha can be present along national borders and along 'adaptive tilling' tiles boundaries.

Lineage of V18 sub-releases:

Main purpose of the release: Publication of final CLC2012 data.
Changes from previous sub-release (V18_4):
•	CLC2012 data covering full ES and TR were integrated including updated version of Canary Islands (ES) data. Thus, CLC2012 fully covers the EEA39.
•	CLC2000 and CLC2006 have been replaced by revised CLC2000 (in 27 countries) and revised CLC2006 (in 34 countries) under the same name (CLC2000, CLC2006). Revised CLC2000 is a by-product of CLC2006 change mapping. Similarly, revised CLC2006 is a by-product of CLC2012. 
Note: In producing the revised CLC2000 and the revised CLC2006 datasets a simple border-harmonisation was applied: only polygons ? 0.1 ha were removed along the borders. Thus, difference in CLC codes can exist along country borders between V18_4 and V18_5 data.

Version 18_4
------------
Release date: 11-10-2015
Main purpose of the release: Maintenance / Increased European coverage of CLC2012 data.
Changes from previous sub-release (V18_3):
•	CLC2012 European coverage has increased, but the coverage is still not full. 37 full countries of the EEA39 are included. The two missing countries, ES and TR are partially covered.  
•	Updated CLC2012 data for DE integrated, but still provisional (see notes below).
Notes: 
1) CLC data for DE are provisional and may contain topological errors and sliver polygons (i.e. polygons under 0.1 ha). Because of this reason sea buffer around DE is not finally harmonized.
2) Because of the partial delivery for Turkey the sea buffer around the country is not fully harmonized.

Version 18_3
------------
Release date: 31-07-2015
Main purpose of the release: Maintenance / Increased European coverage of CLC2012 data.
Changes from previous sub-release (V18_2): 
•	CLC2012 European coverage has increased and includes 37 full countries of the EEA39 and an additional partial delivery for TR. Not covered countries: ES (full) and TR (75% of country). 
•	CLC2012 for the French DOM (Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and Réunion) integrated as delivered. No verification was implemented on these areas.
•	CLC2012 data for DE integrated, but still provisional (see notes below).
•	CLC2006 data included for GR. Thus, CLC2006 data are completed for all EEA39 countries. 
Notes: 
1) CLC data for DE are provisional and may contain topological errors and sliver polygons. Because of this reason the sea buffer around DE is not fully harmonized.  
2) Because of the partial delivery for Turkey the sea buffer around the country is not fully harmonized.

Version 15 (V5)
--------------- 
Release date: 20-07-2011 
Main purpose: Publication of final CLC2006 data.
The 3rd CLC inventory for the reference year of 2006 was produced under GMES Fast Track Service on Land Monitoring. The CLCC database was considered as the primary product, and a uniform change mapping methodology was agreed. Dual date satellite imagery (SPOT-4/5 and IRS P6) taken in 2005-2007 provided enhanced change mapping capabilities. Some of the countries newly entering CLC have produced CLC2000 datasets also during the project time frame. Scanned topographic maps and digital aerial ortho-imagery have become commonly available. CAPI was the prevailing method applied in interpreting of satellite images. Nevertheless, FI, IS, NO, SE and the UK applied a semiautomatic methodology. Most of the European QC was conducted by visiting national teams (see Version 2). In some cases, remote verification was applied (without mission to countries). ES and IT were verified by regions. 
Changes from previous release (V14 (V4)): 
•	CLC2006 data covering Great Britain (part of UK) and TR were delivered. Thus, CLC2006 European coverage includes 38 countries of the EEA39. Still missing CLC2006 data for Greece.
•	A simplified border matching was applied for countries new in CLC: XK, NO, CH and Turkey: 1) <25 ha polygons along the borders are not removed systematically; 2) sliver-like polygons (area < cca. 5 ha) are generalised to largest or thematically most similar neighbour. 
•	For the rest of CLC2006 countries a simple border-matching was applied. Code differences along two sides of borders are not changed. Only polygons with area ? 0,1 ha (sliver polygons) are eliminated. 
•	Data dissemination: CLC data become freely accessible from EEA to any person or legal entity.

Version 14 (V4)
---------------
Release date: 25-10-2010
Main purpose: Maintenance / Increased European coverage of CLC2006 and CLC2000 data.
Changes from previous release (V13 (V3)): 
•	CLC2006 European coverage includes 37 full countries of EEA39.  New data for Northern Ireland (part of the UK), Madeira Islands (part of PT), CH, IS and TR were added to CLC2006 data. Still missing CLC2006: GR and the UK (except Northern Ireland).
•	New data for Madeira Islands (PT), CH and IS were added into the European CLC2000 coverage, which includes already the EE39. However, CLCC(1990,2000) is available for 28 countries only.
•	New data for Madeira Islands (PT) were added into CLC1990 and CLCC(1990,2000). Still missing CLC1990 data: AL, BA, CH, CY, FI, IS, MK, NO, SE, TR, UK and XK.

The seamless European database has been further improved addressing feedback from EEA on V13 (V3):
•	No-data buffer (code 999) outside of valid data area was deleted.
•	Small gaps identified in V13 were corrected by tolerance adaptation in ArcGIS v10 geodatabase.
•	Remaining neighbour polygons with the same code were resolved by additional dissolve operation.
See https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-country-coverage-v14 for full information about this version coverage. 

Version 13 (V3)
---------------
Release date: 02/2010 
Main purpose: Publication of initial European coverage of CLC2006 data. 
Changes from previous release (V2): 
•	Version numbering was changed to harmonise vector data (V3) and derived raster data (V13) releases. 
•	First seamless release in ESRI Geodatabase format.
•	Initial coverage of CLC2006 including 35 countries and Northern Ireland (part of the UK). Missing countries in CLC2006: GR, CH, TR and the UK (except Northern Ireland).
•	Two updates added to CLC2000: a new version for NO and the first CLC dataset for TR.
•	Sea buffer around land has been introduced (15 km as proxy to 12 nautical miles sea zone).

Version 2
---------
Release date: 09/2009
Main purpose: Publication of final CLC2000 coverages.
The 2nd CLC inventory for the reference year of 2000 (CLC2000) was carried out in the frames of I&CLC2000 project. A single date Landsat-7 ETM satellite imagery taken in 1999-2001 was provided by JRC. The technology of drawing the interpretation on transparencies was discarded and replaced by CAPI (computer-assisted photo-interpretation). Prior to mapping changes CLC1990 data had to be corrected: 1) bulk geometric mistakes removed and residual geometric errors >100 m and coding mistakes were corrected; 2) polygons smaller than the 25 ha MMU were generalised. European QC was conducted by visiting national teams (usually at the start and towards the end of the project). Computer-assisted verification has provided written, geo-located explanations regarding the mistakes and supported harmonized production of the database all over Europe. 
Changes from previous release (V1): 
•	It was to deliver a single seamless layer, but was not feasible in ESRI environment. Therefore, seamless ESRI ArcInfo Librarian map tiles were produced again (but free of tiling artefacts reported in V1). 
•	New country deliveries integrated into European CLC2000 ME, RS (incl. XK), IS and NO. Simple harmonization along national borders of these countries was done (small artefacts cleaned only). 
•	CLC2000 data for MT have been updated to reflect changed geometry in CLC2006 delivery.
•	The dissemination and use of products was defined in an agreement between the EEA, the EC and the participating countries.

Version 1
---------
Release date: 08/2005                 
Main purpose: Publication of initial European coverage of CLC2000 and CLCC(1990,2000) data.
Changes from previous release (V0): 
•	The first consolidated version of European CLC data have been produced as integrated and harmonised seamless layer in ESRI ArcInfo Workstation Librarian map tiles.
•	The production of the first CLCC database has started, but no consolidated methodology was available.
•	Initial CLC2000 coverage included 32 countries: AL, AT, BE, BA, BG, CY, CZ, DE, DK, EE, ES, FI, FR, GR, HR, HU, IE, IT, LV, LI, LT, LU, MK, MT, NL, PL, PT, RO, SI, SK, SE and the UK. Missing countries in CLC2000: CH, IS, ME, NO, RS (including XK) and TR.
•	CLC1990 for most of the countries has been replaced by revised CLC1990. Some additional countries have produced CLC1990. Still missing in CLC1990 European coverage: CY, LI, MT, SE and UK. 
•	Full harmonization (visual re-interpretation by keeping the 25 ha MMU) inside a 5-km wide strip along national borders was done including 32 countries for CLC2000 and 24 countries for CLCC(1990,2000). 
•	Semi-automatic harmonisation of 2-km wide strip along national borders was done for CLC1990. 
•	Vector to raster conversion: “cell centre” method was applied.
•	The 25 ha MMU is considered as hard limit. Polygons <25 ha were generalised.
•	Dual ownership of CLC and CLCC data (EEA and the country) was introduced. 

Version 0
---------
Release dates: up to 12/2000
Main purpose: Distribution of country-level CLC1990 data and creation of European raster products.
The period of the first CLC inventory was rather long (1985-1996) and 1990 is considered as reference year. CLC1990 data delivered by countries became part of GISCO database. Releases were provided bi-annually. Following political changes in Central and Eastern Europe 10 additional countries joined. The methodology was visual photointerpretation by drawing the CLC map on transparency, placed on top of satellite image hardcopy at scale 1:100.000.
•	CLC1990 vector and raster data were initially available for 12 countries: AT, BE, DE, DK, ES, FR, GR, IE, IT, LU, NL and PT. Raster only data were available for FI and UK.
•	The EC Phare programme supported the implementation of CLC1990 in 11 countries of Central and Eastern Europe between 1992 and 1998: BG, CZ and SK, EE, LV, LT, HU, PL, RO and SI.
•	Integrated European vector dataset was available as ESRI ArcInfo Librarian and derived raster products as ESRI grids in 100m and 250m resolution.
•	Data dissemination policy was unclear
